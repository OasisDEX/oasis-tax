If you traded or earned any blockchain assets on an Ethereum dapp, Steem, or Bitshares (like ETH, REP, MKR, BTS, SDB, STEEM, or many others), you likely had taxable events and may have a tax liability.

Token.tax is a service that parses a variety of decentralized applications where tokens are earned or exchanged, and summarizes them in a way your accounting software can understand. It will collect all relevant data for an arbitrary number of trades and email it to you for just $1, payable as SBD, bitUSD, or ETH.

Our data works well with cointracking.info because they have good price information useful in obscure token-for-token trades, and because it allows you to aggregate trade information from centralized exchanges. This can be combined with our income data (relevant for Steem users), which should cover most crypto-asset related tax issues.
